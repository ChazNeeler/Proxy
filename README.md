# Proxy

This was a group project where the team was given the task of creating a proxy server in C.  

The server would receive an HTTP request for an object and replace it with it's own request for the same object from a remote server, creating a sterile environment where the traffic could be controlled.  

A blacklist was run to ban set domains, and the team was also given a list of vulgar words to censor as well.

A word document is attached discussing the challenges the team faced and how they were addressed.
